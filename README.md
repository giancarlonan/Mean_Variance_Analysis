# 📊 Mean-Variance Analysis with Modern Portfolio Theory

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that I created to explore **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** using mean-variance analysis. The code demonstrates how to construct an investment portfolio that balances expected returns against risk.

## 🔍 Overview

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952, provides a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets to optimize the trade-off between risk and return. 

In this notebook, I have:
- Retrieved historical price data for selected assets.
- Calculated key metrics like returns, variances, and covariances.
- Determined optimal asset allocations for various risk-return profiles.
- Visualised the **Efficient Frontier**, which shows the set of optimal portfolios.

## 🚀 What’s Included

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

1. **Data Collection:** Fetch historical price data for multiple assets.
2. **Data Processing:** Calculate daily returns, variance, covariance, and portfolio metrics.
3. **Portfolio Optimization:** Solve for optimal weights that minimize risk or maximize returns.
4. **Visualization:** Plot the Efficient Frontier and highlight important portfolios like the Global Minimum Variance Portfolio and Tangency Portfolio.

## 🌟 Why This Code?

This notebook represents my effort to translate the concepts from my Financial Economics lecture notes into practical code. It's a hands-on exploration of the theory I studied, focusing on portfolio optimization.
